## Exporatory Data Analysis

``` r
manhattan_rides_df %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week, year) %>% 
  summarize(obs = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = obs, group = year, color = year)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

Fewer rides during the week in 2020 (presumably because of WFH), but
more rides on the weekends (presumably because people avoid subway/
ubers)

``` r
manhattan_rides_df %>% 
  group_by(start_date, year) %>% 
  summarize(obs = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = start_date, y = obs, group = year, color = year)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

Not that helpful, but not a meaningful difference in numbers of rides
between 2019 and 2020 except maybe March/ April where there appears to
be a slight dip
