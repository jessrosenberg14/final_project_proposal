## The tentative project title

**Impact of COVID on Citi Bike Usage in Manhattan**

## The motivation for this project

During the height of the pandemic, Citi Bikes played an integral part in
helping to transport critical workers around NYC. Many people in NYC
also likely switched from riding the subway regularly to seeking
alternative transportation methods. We are interested in understanding
how transportation trends across NYC changed during the pandemic and
since vaccinations became widely available in early 2021.

## The intended final products

Website (with dashboard) and final report.

## The anticipated data sources

-   Citi Bike Data (<https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data>)

-   MTA Ridership Data (<https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership>)

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Planned analyses**

-   We will be performing descriptive analyses: \# of new stations, \#
    of new users, ages of users, sex of users, \# of riders (MTA)

-   What amount of reduction in MTA ridership is compensated by increase
    in Citi Bike ridership

-   We may run a clustering analysis

**Planned visualizations**

-   An animated heat map showing trends over time

-   Interactive maps for NYC boroughs (except for Staten Island)

-   Data visualization showing trends in sign-ups

-   Interactive timeline that shows different COVID milestones and Citi
    Bike trends

-   Data visualization showing changes in MTA ridership trends vs. Citi
    Bike ridership trends

**Coding Challenges**

-   Ways to filter the dataset (the dataset is huge!)

-   How to create our intended visualizations (especially how to figure
    out how to show trends over time as we haven’t learned this in
    class)

-   Defining boundaries to lat/long by borough vs. using station IDs

## The planned timeline

-   Download and clean datasets: by November 22nd

-   Initial exploratory analyses: by November 26th

-   Creation of data visualizations/maps: by December 1st

-   Creation of website: by December 3rd

-   Feedback Collection: by December 6th

-   Writing Report: by December 10th

-   Finalization of work products: by December 10th
